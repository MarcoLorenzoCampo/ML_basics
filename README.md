## Introduction

In this section, you will learn the basic concepts of machine learning and its applications in various domains. We will cover the key terminologies, the types of machine learning algorithms, and the overall workflow of a typical machine learning project.

## Clustering

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. In this section, we will explore popular clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering. You will understand how these algorithms work and how to evaluate the clustering results.

## Classification

Classification is a supervised learning technique used to predict the class or category of a given input data point. In this section, we will delve into different classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. You will learn how to train, evaluate, and make predictions using these algorithms.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values based on input features. In this section, we will cover simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. You will understand the underlying mathematics, how to train a linear regression model, and how to interpret the results.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks are a powerful class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. In this section, we will introduce the basics of neural networks, including the building blocks such as neurons, activation functions, and layers. You will also learn how to design and train neural networks using popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
