K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into a pre-defined
number of groups (k). The algorithm works by partitioning the data points into k clusters based on their similarity.
The value of k is pre-defined by the user, and the algorithm tries to minimize the sum of the squared distances between
the data points and their assigned cluster centers.

1. Initialization: The algorithm randomly selects k data points from the dataset as the initial cluster centroids.
These initial centers can be chosen in various ways, such as randomly, using a heuristic, or by applying some other
clustering algorithm.

2. Assignment: Each data point is assigned to the cluster with the nearest cluster center based on the Euclidean
distance between the data point and the cluster center. This step is sometimes called the "assignment step".

3. Update: After all data points are assigned to their nearest cluster center, the algorithm calculates the mean of
the data points in each cluster and updates the cluster center accordingly. This step is sometimes called the
"update step".

4. Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until convergence or until a pre-defined number of iterations is reached.
Convergence is typically achieved when the assignment of data points to clusters no longer changes or changes very
little between iterations.

The final result of the K-means algorithm is a set of k cluster centers and the assignment of each data point to a
cluster. The algorithm aims to minimize the sum of the squared distances between the data points and their assigned
cluster centers, which is known as the "within-cluster sum of squares" or "inertia".

The problem is performance, each iteration explores the whole dataset for k times. And each element of the dataset needs
to be explored for each possible feature.
